This project is supplementary material to the Cell contributed article “Spiders are capsules of viral diversity and neglected vectors with zoonotic risks”. Here we provide, where possible, the script code used for assembly and RNA lookup and details of its implementation. In addition we provide the evolutionary tree from the Supplementary Material as supplementary material.
Here we express our special thanks to UriNeri, some of the code in this topic is borrowed from previous projects: https://github.com/UriNeri/RVMT
